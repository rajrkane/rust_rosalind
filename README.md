This repository contains standalone solutions in Rust to Computational Biology problems on [Rosalind](https://rosalind.info/problems). Standalone means that, inevitably, there is code duplication across solutions.

## Usage

Pass the algorithm name exactly as on Rosalind. For example, for [RandomizedMotifSearch](https://rosalind.info/problems/ba2f), the command is 
`cargo build && cargo run RandomizedMotifSearch`.
